# Object Detection in FIFA Game

## About This Project
The "Object Detection in FIFA Game" project is at the forefront of integrating AI with sports gaming, utilizing YOLOv8, Streamlit, and OpenCV technologies. It aims to transform in-game analytics by accurately identifying elements such as Team A, Team B, and the ball within FIFA game footage. This initiative uses YOLOv8 for its exceptional real-time object detection capabilities, trained on a dataset comprising 1000 images and over 5000 annotations. OpenCV is employed to efficiently process video frames, ensuring precise object identification. Furthermore, Streamlit is leveraged to deploy this model, offering an interactive user interface that demonstrates the model's performance. This project not only elevates the gaming experience but also paves the way for innovative strategies in game analysis and coaching, marking a significant leap in the fusion of sports gaming and artificial intelligence.
